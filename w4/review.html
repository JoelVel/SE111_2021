            <em>WarGames</em> is fun little movie about a very smart kid who accidentally gained access to a military computer system believing 
            it to be the website of video game development company. In the process he start a nuclear attack simultation, believing he is playing
            one of their unleased games, which NORAD mistakes for a real nuclear attack. This movie is a very fun movie to watch and its not too intense, 
            but its very predictable, but that's expected in old 80s movies.

                The studio had the Galaxian (1979) and Galaga (1981) arcade machines delivered to Matthew Broderick's home. 
                He practiced for two months to prepare for the arcade scene.

                The WOPR, as seen in the movie, was made of wood and painted with a metal-finish paint. 
                As the crew filmed the displays of the WOPR, Special Effects Supervisor Michael L. 
                Fink sat inside and entered information into an Apple II computer that drove the countdown display.

                The tunnel and exterior used for the entrance into NORAD is located in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California. 
                The same tunnel was used to enter and exit Toontown in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), and in the climax of Back To The Future II (1989).

                This movie inspired Congress to create the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984. 
                Representative Dan Glickman (D-Kansas) opened the proceedings by saying, "We are gonna show about four minutes from the movie '<em>WarGames</em>,' which outlines the problem fairly clearly." 
                A House committee report said "'<em>WarGames</em>' showed a realistic representation of the automatic dialing and access capabilities of the personal computer."
